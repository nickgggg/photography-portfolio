			Oh, there once was a puffin

			<br>Just the shape of a muffin

			<br>And he lived on an island in the bright blue sea.

			<br>He ate little fishes

			<br>Which were most delicious,

			<br>And he had them for breakfast and he had them for tea.

			<br>But this poor little puffin,

			<br>He couldn’t play nothin’

			<br>For he hadn’t anybody to play with at all.

			<br>So he stood in the water and he thought for a while,

			<br>And he felt very little and he felt very small.

			<br>Then along came the fishes and they said if you wishes

			<br>You can have us for playmates instead of for tea.

			<br>So they now play together

			<br>In all sorts of weather,

			<br>And the puffin eats pancakes, like you and like me.</p>
